Raise your hand if you didn’t know what butter chicken was until recently… Wait, why am I the only one raising my hand? Ok, listen, y’all: My boyfriend is from India. When we first started dating, he introduced me to butter chicken. I’m a big fan of anything with chicken. Fried, grilled, roasted, smothered in god-knows-what. It’s all good. This recipe is a compilation of authentic recipes I’ve found during the past year and a half. I had some help creating (and tasting) it, thanks to my boyfriend. Go ahead, throw out all those other recipes! Serve it with some rice or flat bread; I dare ya!

**Ingredients (for the gravy):**

\- 5 roma tomatoes

\- 1 medium onion, diced

\- 2 or 3 green chillies (deseed if you'd prefer a milder gravy)

\- 1/4 stick butter

\- 2 cinnamon sticks

\- red chili powder

\- coriander powder

\- green cardamom pods

\- salt and pepper to taste

\-kasoori methi

**Ingredients (for the chicken):**

\- 1 lb chicken (breast or thigh works best), cut into 1.5 inch cubes

\- 1 tbsp lemon juice

\- 3 tbsp yogurt

\- 1.5 tsp red chili powder

\- 1.5 tsp coriander powder

\- 1.5 tsp cumin powder

\- 2 or 3 garlic cloves (I prefer to microplane them, but you can finely chop it, too)

\- 1 inch fresh ginger (also prefer to microplane, but it can also be finely chopped)

\- Sprinkle of salt and pepper

**Chicken:**

First preheat oven to 400*. Combine ingredients for the marinade and coat the chicken with it. For best results, marinate chicken for at least half an hour. (Chicken can safely marinate for up to two days in the refrigerator.) Place the chicken pieces on a pan with a rack and bake for 12 minutes (more or less, depending on how large you cut the chicken pieces). Broil chicken for another 7 minutes until it appears slightly browned and charred. This provides you with a "tandoori" style chicken.

If you'd prefer, the chicken can also be cooked in a pan on the stovetop for approximately 15 minutes on medium heat.

**Gravy:**

Heat a medium to large pan on the stovetop. Put butter or ghee into the pan. Allow it to heat and add garlic, ginger, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, green chillies, and dried red chillies to the pan. Dice onion and tomatoes, then add them to the heated spices. Cover and cook until the onion is translucent and tomatoes are soft. Add turmeric, garam masala, cumin, coriander, and red chili powder. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cook for approximately three minutes, combining all spices and the onion/tomato mixture. Remove the cinnamon sticks before transferring contents of the pan to a blender. Allow the mixture to cool for several minutes, then blend the mixture until it is a thick sauce. (Tip: While it is cooling, this is usually when I begin to cook the chicken. :))

Add two tbsp of butter into the pan. You may add more spices, such as red chili powder and coriander. Pour the mixture back into the pan. You may strain it for a smoother sauce, but it is not necessary (just more stuff to clean!). Add approximately one cup of water to the mixture. Let simmer for five minutes before adding the cooked chicken. Add 1 tbsp of cream and kasoori methi to taste. Serve with rice or flatbread (naan, roti, paratha).
