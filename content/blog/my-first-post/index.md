Wow! I love reading food blogs, but I'm tired of getting carpel tunnel from having to scroll through
bloggers' life stories.

In this blog you'll find simple reciepes with no fluff.

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either.
